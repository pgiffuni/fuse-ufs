//! The metadata buffer seam.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! The architectural rule the Soft Updates work rests on is that *no UFS
//! metadata mutation may reach the device directly*.  Enforcing that by hand
//! would mean scattering `self.buf.get_mut(...)` and `blk * fs_bsize`
//! arithmetic through every filesystem function, which is exactly the kind of
//! mechanical repetition that gets one call site wrong.  So all of it lives
//! here, once, and the rest of the crate goes through the handful of helpers
//! below.
//!
//! # The three layers, and which one this is
//!
//! ```text
//! UFS metadata mutation
//!     -> BufferCache::get_mut()      <- this module: the live image
//!     -> modify the live image
//!     -> create a dependency / gate   <- crate::softdep
//!     -> dependency resolution
//!     -> Buffer::publish()            <- crate::softdep
//!     -> BufferCache::write_back()    <- the only thing that writes
//!     -> BlockDevice::write_at()      <- crate::decoder
//! ```
//!
//! * [`crate::softdep::DependencyEngine`] decides *which parts* of a live
//!   image may be persisted.
//! * [`crate::buf::BufferCache`] decides *when*, and is the only caller of the
//!   device.
//! * this module is below both of them: it turns "a metadata structure changed"
//!   into "these bytes of that cached block changed", and nothing more.
//!
//! Getting a helper into the right one of those three boxes is the whole
//! design discipline of the series; a helper that writes to the device, or one
//! that decides on its own that a range is safe, belongs nowhere near this file.
//!
//! # Serialization is separate from persistence
//!
//! [`Ufs::metadata_write`] serializes a structure with this filesystem's byte
//! order and copies the bytes into a cached block.  It does *not* write the
//! block out: that is the cache's business.  Keeping the two apart is what lets
//! an existing `self.file.encode_at(...)` call site be converted without
//! changing a single byte of the image — `Decoder::encode_to_vec` produces
//! exactly the bytes `Decoder::encode_at` would have written — and it is what
//! lets a gated byte range inside one of those structures be held back while
//! the rest of the block goes out normally.
//!
//! # This is a *metadata* cache
//!
//! Ordinary file data does not come through here.  `inode_read_block()` and
//! `inode_write_block()` are deliberately still direct `Read`/`Write` calls on
//! the decoder: the kernel's page cache is already buffering that data, there
//! are no cross-block ordering constraints between two blocks of a file's
//! payload, and adding a second buffer layer for it would turn every FUSE
//! writeback into an ordering question for no benefit.  See the module
//! documentation of [`crate::buf`] for the same distinction.
//!
//! # Units
//!
//! Two different block numbers meet in this file, and conflating them is the
//! single easiest way to corrupt an image:
//!
//! | unit | size | used by |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | UFS "block" | `fs_fsize`, a *fragment* | `blk_alloc_for`, `cg_start`, `ino_to_fsba`, every on-disk pointer |
//! | `BufferCache` block | `fs_bsize` | [`Ufs::metadata_blk`], the cache, the device |
//!
//! UFS addresses in fragments because `fs_fpg` — the size of a cylinder group —
//! is a fragment count and `fs_iblkno` is a fragment offset, so `cg_start()` and
//! `ino_to_fsba()` both return fragment addresses even though they are named as
//! blocks.  [`Ufs::metadata_blk`] and [`Ufs::metadata_blk_off`] are the only
//! places that conversion happens.

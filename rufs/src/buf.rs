//! A buffer cache with explicit dirty and safe-to-write state.
//!
//! # Why a dirty buffer is not the same thing as a write
//!
//! Everything this driver did before this module existed had one rule: modify
//! metadata, then write it to the device immediately.  That rule is why a
//! FUSE `mkdir` could not be made crash-safe without rewriting the allocator,
//! the directory code and the inode code all at once, and it is the single
//! structural reason `sys/ufs/ffs/ffs_softdep.c` is 9000 lines: FreeBSD had to
//! build a second, shadow copy of every in-core metadata object (a "safe" copy
//! and a "live" copy) plus a dependency graph to decide which of the two to
//! write, because the VFS path could no longer be changed to delay writes.
//!
//! Here the split is explicit from the start:
//!
//! * the **block device interface** ([`BlockDevice`]) is raw `read_at`/`write_at`
//!   and nothing else;
//! * the **buffer cache** ([`BufferCache`]) owns contents, dirtiness, and the
//!   *live* versus *safe* distinction, and is the only thing that talks to the
//!   device;
//! * the **dependency engine** decides when it is safe to write a buffer, and
//!   tells the cache via [`BufferCache::write_back`].
//!
//! A buffer is therefore dirty long before it is writable, and the two events
//! are separate calls.  Filesystem operations call [`BufferCache::get_mut`],
//! which marks the buffer dirty; only the dependency engine gets to write.
//!
//! # Live versus safe
//!
//! [`Buffer`] carries two images:
//!
//! * the **live** image, what the running filesystem believes is on disk and
//!   what `readdir` must see;
//! * an optional **safe** image, the last state of the buffer that is safe to
//!   make persistent.
//!
//! They differ exactly when the buffer contains a pointer to a block that is not
//! yet safe to write — a new indirect block that has not been initialised, a
//! directory entry naming an inode that has not been written.  Concretely, if a
//! live indirect block is `[A B C D]` and `C` is a freshly allocated block whose
//! bitmap bit is not yet on disk, the safe image is `[A B 0 D]`: writing the live
//! image would leave a persistent pointer to a block the cylinder-group bitmap
//! still calls free, and `fsck_ffs` would report a block that is simultaneously
//! allocated and owned.
//!
//! The safe image is produced by
//! [`BufferCache::unsafe_write`] plus [`BufferCache::publish`]: a caller says
//! "these byte ranges are not safe yet", the cache maintains a safe image that
//! differs from the live image only in those ranges, and `publish` clears the
//! pending-unsafe marks when the dependency that was blocking them resolves.
//!
//! # Why not reuse `BlockReader`
//!
//! [`crate::blockreader::BlockReader`] is a streaming `Read + Write + Seek`
//! adapter with a one-block cache that flushes on every write.  It is the right
//! thing for *file data*, where the kernel is the only writer and there are no
//! cross-block ordering constraints.  It is the wrong thing for metadata, which
//! is what this module is for.  Keeping them separate is deliberate: a file
//! data write must never be delayed by, or ordered against, a metadata write.

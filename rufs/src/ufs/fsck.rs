//! An `fsck_ffs`-shaped consistency checker.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! FreeBSD's `sbin/fsck_ffs` is the reference for what a UFS2 filesystem is
//! allowed to look like, and it is *not* available on the platforms this
//! driver builds and tests on.  What is available is the definition of the
//! five passes, so this module re-derives the checks that matter for
//! allocation and ordering bugs:
//!
//! | pass | what it does | what it would catch here |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 1 | walk every inode, check block ownership and block sizes | a pointer to a free block; a block owned twice |
//! | 2 | check directory format, `.` and `..`, entry targets | a directory entry pointing at an uninitialised inode |
//! | 3 | check connectivity to the root | an orphaned subtree |
//! | 4 | rebuild link counts from the directory tree | a link count decremented before its directory entry was removed |
//! | 5 | rebuild every bitmap and summary from scratch | a summary that disagrees with its bitmap, or with the global totals |
//!
//! Pass 5 is the one that matters most for this driver, because pass 5 is a
//! *rebuild*: it compares nothing against the on-disk counters except at the
//! end, so it catches every counter drift that passes 1-4 cannot see.
//!
//! # Not a substitute for fsck_ffs
//!
//! This checker does not implement cluster accounting, extended attributes,
//! snapshots, quotas, ACLs, the `ckhash` metadata checksums, or any repair.
//! It is a read-only oracle for tests.  It is deliberately conservative: it
//! reports a problem rather than guessing whether a discrepancy is benign,
//! and the callers in the test suite treat every reported problem as a bug.

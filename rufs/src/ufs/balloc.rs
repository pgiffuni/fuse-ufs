//! Block allocation: the *implementation* half of the policy split.
//!
//! [`crate::policy`] decides *where*; this module decides *whether it is
//! possible* and performs the bookkeeping.  Nothing here has an opinion about
//! locality: given a [`BlockPref`] it tries that cylinder group, that block,
//! then that cylinder group's rotor, then falls back through the cylinder
//! overflow search, and finally fails with `ENOSPC`.
//!
//! # The cylinder-overflow search
//!
//! FreeBSD's `ffs_hashalloc()` implements a three-step fallback, and this
//! module reproduces it exactly because the *order* matters for
//! near-full filesystems:
//!
//! 1. the preferred cylinder group,
//! 2. a quadratic rehash — `+1, +2, +4, +8, …` cylinder groups, wrapping —
//!    which touches distant parts of the disk before nearby parts,
//! 3. a brute-force sweep of every cylinder group from `preferred + 2`.
//!
//! The quadratic step is not an optimisation.  On a filesystem that is 99%
//! full, the cylinder groups nearest the preference are the ones most likely
//! to be full too, so a linear nearby-first search would rescan the same dead
//! cylinder groups on every single allocation.  Rehashing outwards finds the
//! few surviving cylinder groups after `log2(ncg)` probes instead of `ncg`.
//!
//! # Bitmap representation
//!
//! The UFS2 block bitmap (`cg_blksfree`) has one bit per *fragment*, packed
//! `fs_frag` bits to a byte, and a bit set means *free*.  A whole block is a
//! run of `fs_frag` consecutive fragments, which is always byte-aligned, so
//! whole-block allocation reduces to "find a byte whose `fs_frag` bits are all
//! set".
//!
//! [`BlkMap`] holds that byte array in memory for the duration of one
//! allocation.  The alternative — reading and writing individual map bytes
//! through the decoder inside a scan loop — turns a single allocation into
//! potentially `fpg` seeks.
//!
//! # Divergence from FreeBSD: whole blocks only
//!
//! FreeBSD allocates a run of `fs_frag` fragments when the request cannot be
//! satisfied as a fragment (`ffs_alloccg()`), and tracks the tail as free
//! fragments in `cg_nffree`/`cg_frsum`.  This implementation always allocates
//! and frees *whole blocks* and never touches `cg_nffree` or `cg_frsum`.
//!
//! The reason is not laziness: FreeBSD's fragment path relies on
//! `ffs_fragextend()`, which grows an existing fragment allocation *in place*
//! by clearing more bits of the same block.  Without that, a file whose tail
//! grows from one fragment to two would be given a *second* block by
//! `inode_write_block()` (it reuses the resolved block rather than
//! reallocating), leaking the first.  Whole-block allocation keeps
//! allocate/free exactly symmetric — which is the invariant that actually
//! protects `fsck` phase 5 — at the cost of wasting up to `fs_bsize - 1`
//! bytes in the last block of each file.  Restoring fragment allocation
//! requires in-place extension and is explicitly a follow-up.

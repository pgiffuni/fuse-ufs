//! UFS2 cylinder-group geometry.
//!
//! # Which structures are on disk?
//!
//! Everything in [`crate::data`] is a literal transcription of a UFS2 on-disk
//! structure and is encoded/decoded with `bincode-next`, so field order *is*
//! layout.  In particular [`Superblock`], [`CylGroup`] and [`Inode`] must not be
//! "improved" without changing the disk format.  Everything in this module is
//! runtime-only bookkeeping derived from those structures and is never
//! serialized.
//!
//! # Cylinder-group geometry
//!
//! A UFS2 filesystem is divided into `ncg` equally sized *cylinder groups*
//! (CGs).  Each CG holds `fpg` fragments of `fsize` bytes, addressed as a
//! single contiguous run of filesystem blocks starting at `cg * fpg`.  Within
//! a CG the layout is fixed by three superblock offsets, in increasing address
//! order:
//!
//! ```text
//!  cg_start(cg)                                              cg_end(cg)
//!      |                                                            |
//!      | super | cyl struct | inode blk | ... | METADATA zone | DATA zone |
//!      |     ^sblkno        ^iblkno            ^dblkno           ^dblkno+metaspace
//! ```
//!
//! * **Inode area** — `cg_inode_start .. cg_inode_end`, exactly
//!   `howmany(ipg, inopb)` blocks.  It comes first because `fs_iblkno` is the
//!   smallest of the three offsets and because inode lookup is the hottest
//!   path: `ino_to_fsba()` must be a shift/add away.
//! * **Metadata zone** — `cg_meta_start .. cg_data_start`.  Directories and
//!   indirect blocks live here.  It exists because those structures are
//!   read together with the CG superblock during `fsck` phase 1 and during
//!   filesystem repair, and because the first `metaspace` blocks of the data
//!   zone are the only place left that is guaranteed contiguous and free when
//!   a large file needs a second-level indirect block.
//! * **Data zone** — `cg_data_start .. cg_end`.  Ordinary file data prefers
//!   here.  It is the largest area, so spreading bulk data over it keeps the
//!   metadata zone available for the metadata that must be adjacent to the CG
//!   superblock.
//!
//! The metadata zone is a *preference*, not a fence: when it is exhausted,
//! allocation spills into ordinary data space.  See [`Superblock::cg_meta_start`]
//! and the fallback ladder in [`crate::policy`].
//!
//! # Relationship to FreeBSD
//!
//! FreeBSD spells these as the macros `cgstart()`, `cgbase()`, `cgimin()`,
//! `cgimax()`, `cgdmin()`, `cgmeta()` and `cgdata()` in `sys/ufs/ffs/fs.h`, and
//! `cgmetabase()` in `sys/ufs/ffs/ffs_subr.c`.  They were used here as a
//! behavioural specification only; the Rust versions below are written from
//! scratch with explicit names and checked by unit tests.

// This module is the documented UFS2 geometry surface: not every accessor is
// used by every build configuration (fragment- and cluster-allocation support
// are still being added), and each one is part of the on-disk-format contract
// that `data.rs` describes.
